# Machine Learning Glossary

*This machine learning glossary is a collection of definitions curated from different sources.*

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

> *Convolutional neural network; a type of neural network that works particularly well for computer vision tasks. [^1]*

**Datablock**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Dataloader**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Dataset**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Epoch**

> *One complete pass through the input data. [^1]*

**Fine-tune**

> *Update a pretrained model for a different task. [^1]*

**Fit / Fitting**

> *Update the parameters of the model such that the predictions of the model using the input data match the target labels. [^1]*

**Hyper Parameters**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Label**

> *The data that we're trying to predict, such as "dog" or "cat". [^1]*

**Learning Rate**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Loss Function**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Loss Value**

> *A measure of how good the model is, chosen to drive training via SGD. [^1]*

**Machine Learning**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Metric**

> *A measurement of how good the model is, using the validation set, chosen for human consumption. [^1]*

**Model**

> *The combination of the architecture with a particular set of parameters. [^1]*

**Neural Network**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Overfitting**

> *Training a model in such a way that it _remembers_ specific features of the input data, rather than generalizing well to data not seen during training. [^1]*

**Parameters**

> *The values in the model that change what task it can do, and are updated through model training. [^1]*

**Prediction** 

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Pretrain / Pretrained model** 

> *A model that has already been trained, generally using a large dataset, and will be fine-tuned. [^1]*

**Segmentation**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Tensor**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Test (set)**

> *Definition coming soon.*

**Train / Training**

> *A synonym for _fit_. [^1]*

**Training Set**

> *The data used for fitting the model; does not include any data from the validation set. [^1]*

**Valid / Validation dataset**

> *A set of data held out from training, used only for measuring how good the model is. [^1]*
