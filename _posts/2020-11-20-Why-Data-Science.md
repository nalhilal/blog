# Why Data Science

## Before you begin 

Before I delve into talking about data science I need to make a few things clear. I have had no formal education in data science. I am self-learning through different resources online, so it is only reasonable for you to keep in mind that as a beginner student some of what I will be posting or talking about here will not be accurate or may be completely incorrect. This blog is not to be taken very seriously neither should be it be used as a definitive resource of facts or information. I am no reference neither am I an expert. 

*tl;dr Don't quote me.*

## Technology, Data, and Me

I have always enjoyed meddling with computers, hardware, software, networks, coding, digital art, and all in all, I enjoy it very much. I taught computer related courses at a college and when that got too repetitive for me I moved to an admin post where I find ways to enhance the learning and education where I work. Technology was my job and is still my hobby for a long time to come. 

Recently, I have been reading about machine learning and the hype that is data science. I was curious to understand what exactly was going on and how can machines learn to predict and identify certain types of data. I understand that statistics plays a huge part in understanding, visualizing, and forcasting specific data so I had assumed that the software is a complex statistical model that spits out predictions or data relavant to its input. I don't believe that I'm totally wrong here. In fact, I believe in essence this is how it is, except that not only are these complex statistical models but there is a specific algorithm that allows the "learning" to take place.

## The Data Science World

My interest in machine learning skyrocketted the more I read about it. The more I understand the data science world the more I understand how important it is especially now. I do not believe there is any other time in history where so much information is being collected, categorized, stored, and processed. The key is understanding what this data can tell us and how can we use it to make the world a better place. What does the data mean, and how can computers process this data to produce useful tools to push us one step forward towards achieving a better world. 

Data science is a vast sea. Advernturers have set sail to explore the world of data and understand it. That's how I see it at least. If you are considering to explore data science, machine learning, or exploring big data now is the time to get your feet wet and see what is in store for you on this journey.
