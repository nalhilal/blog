            "content": "Why Data Science . Before you begin . Before I delve into talking about data science I need to make a few things clear. I have had no formal education in data science. I am self-learning through different resources online, so it is only reasonable for you to keep in mind that as a beginner student some of what I will be posting or talking about here will not be accurate or may be completely incorrect. This blog is not to be taken very seriously neither should be it be used as a definitive resource of facts or information. I am no reference neither am I an expert. . tl;dr Don’t quote me. . Technology, Data, and Me . I have always enjoyed meddling with computers, hardware, software, networks, coding, digital art, and all in all, I enjoy it very much. I taught computer related courses at a college and when that got too repetitive for me I moved to an admin post where I find ways to enhance the learning and education where I work. Technology was my job and is still my hobby for a long time to come. . Recently, I have been reading about machine learning and the hype that is data science. I was curious to understand what exactly was going on and how can machines learn to predict and identify certain types of data. I understand that statistics plays a huge part in understanding, visualizing, and forcasting specific data so I had assumed that the software is a complex statistical model that spits out predictions or data relavant to its input. I don’t believe that I’m totally wrong here. In fact, I believe in essence this is how it is, except that not only are these complex statistical models but there is a specific algorithm that allows the “learning” to take place. . The Data Science World . My interest in machine learning skyrocketted the more I read about it. The more I understand the data science world the more I understand how important it is especially now. I do not believe there is any other time in history where so much information is being collected, categorized, stored, and processed. The key is understanding what this data can tell us and how can we use it to make the world a better place. What does the data mean, and how can computers process this data to produce useful tools to push us one step forward towards achieving a better world. . Data science is a vast sea. Advernturers have set sail to explore the world of data and understand it. That’s how I see it at least. If you are considering to explore data science, machine learning, or exploring big data now is the time to get your feet wet and see what is in store for you on this journey. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

            "title": "An Example Markdown Post",
            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
